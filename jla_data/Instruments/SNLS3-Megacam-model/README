1) Transmissions of filters 

This instrument is an alteration of REOSC_SCAN, to account for the
f/4 beam: since light rays cross the filter at an angle, the bandpasses
are blueshifted (because these are interference filters). 

The code that computes these blueshifts is called blueshift_filter.cc
in snfit. One needs refractive indexes which were deduced from Tom
Benedict's measurements of the filters as a function of crossing
angle (harcoded in the source code).

2) Quantum Efficiency

* QE_camera_mean_model.dat : 
from CFHT web : http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/MegaCam_QE_data.txt
Those data correspond to the mean modelled QE from table 17 in the CCD test report of MegaCam done at CEA
(see http://dphs10.saclay.cea.fr/Sap/Activites/Projets/Megacam/index.html)


* QE_camera_high_res_model.dat : 
New model with better sampling (10 nm) that goes down to 280 nm.
It is also from CFHT web : http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/data.MegaPrime/E2V_CCD42-90_QEmodel.txt
This is the one we used in Astier 2005 paper.

3) Optics transmission and mirror reflection

* CFHT_MegaPrime_Transmission.txt :
Transmission model of the Wide-Field Corrector and the camera window
is derived from combining all the transmission and diffusion effects
of the various glass and coatings. 
* CFHT_Primary_Transmission.txt
Reflectivity model for the primary mirror is of a freshly coated,
bare aluminum.

CFHT_MegaPrime_Transmission.txt and CFHT_Primary_Transmission.txt were downloaded from
http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/specsinformation.html
in January 2006.

* Optics_TR.dat and cfht.Al_coating.dat are older versions of these transmissions also retrieved from CFHT web site.
Those are the ones that were used for the Astier 2006 paper.

4) Atmospheric absorption 

* vapor_maunakea.dat : typical vapor absorption lines at airmass 1 
(used to improve the modeling of the effective z-band transmission in the Astier 2006 paper)

* atmospheric_transmission_from_snifs.dat : atmospheric transmission as measured on SNIFS by the SNFactory
	for an airmass of 1

* atmospheric_transmission_from_snifs_with_tl.dat : atmospheric transmission as measured on SNIFS by the SNFactory including telluring absorption lines as measured above Kitt Peak (Hinkle 2003) obtained from ftp://ftp.noao.edu/catalogs/atmospheric_transmission/
